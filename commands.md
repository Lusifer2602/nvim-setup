# grep
    Global Regular Expression Print

used to search text files with regular expressions (shortly regex). It prints the lines matching the given pattern in a text file. If no file is given, grep will recursively search the given pattern in the files in current directory.

Grep has two variants, egrep & fgrep.
Instead of using grep -e or grep -f one can use egrep or fgrep respectively.
